                            <p>In 1998, envisioning a world without hunger, Help Hunger Hunt started as a family. Our work is the recognition that ending hunger is more than just feeding people, which led us to focus its feeding programs across the world.</p>

                            <p>If an organization's identity contains within in it a distinct contrast between its essential characteristics, that's often good tagline material. Here, Help Hunger Hunt surprises with its crystal-clear tagline that conveys not only what's unique about it but also capitalizes on the contrast between profit and compassion.</p>

In  partnership with MAP International, Help Hunger Hunt is prepared to ship nearly $20 million of nutritious meals and medical aid to in-country partners in Liberia and Sierra Leone to combat the COVID-19 crisis. Our pending shipments will provide life-saving aid for Liberia and Sierra Leone’s most vulnerable.<br><br> At the Ganta United Methodist Hospital in Ganta, Liberia, pregnant and nursing mothers and those suffering from malaria come to seek treatment. Administered by the United Methodist Church of Liberia, the hospital was established in 1926 and is now located in Nimba County. What began as a rural health post has today grown to a regional referral hospital. About 60% of the residents of Nimba County are beneficiaries of their health care programs. Thus, the hospital has an estimated service population of approximately 277,215. Many of these patients have compromised immune systems, compounding the risk of contracting COVID-19. These meals and medicines will provide life-saving aid for Liberia’s most vulnerable who are challenged with limited resources and the threat of malnutrition. <br><br> About the Author: <br><br> Janae Curtain is the Digital Marketing Coordinator on the Help Hunger Hunt Marketing Team.
